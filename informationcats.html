    <h3>information</h3>
    <p>Cats are pets. There is a myth that a cat has 9 lives, although this is not true, life is only one. Just cats are very tenacious. Cats love milk and catch mice. Cats are domestic doctors. If you put the cat on the chest, then it takes away the disease. Although this is not true, but cats really calmed the human nervous system. Cats are very attached to the house. One cat was lost a hundred kilometers from home, and three weeks later she returned. And it is true.</p>
